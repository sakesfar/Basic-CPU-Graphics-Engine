**This project is inspired by https://www.scratchapixel.com/. And so far, the project is not unique from their outcome. Yet, I am doing my best**

This project is currenyly under development and going to take a considerable time.

The idea is to create a simple 3D engine which will be able to render a 3D object in real-time.
The calculation will be in CPU. Very likely will be using Qt GUI.

So far, the project is in a raw format. 
However:
1. It already accommodates the stage of projection a 3D object using rasterization using z-buffer to resolve visibility. As an example, the project generates a PPM file of a sample 3D cow.
2. It also contains a Projection Matrix similar to OpenGL's one.
