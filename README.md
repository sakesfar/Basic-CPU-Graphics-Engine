**This project is inspired by https://www.scratchapixel.com/. And so far, the project is not unique from their outcome. Yet, I am doing my best**

This project is currenyly under development. 
The project is going take a considerable time.

The idea is to create a simple 3D engine which will be able to project 3D world in real time.
The calucation will be in CPU. Very likely will be using Qt GUI.

So far, the project is in a raw format. 
However:
1. It already accommodates the stage of projection a 3D object using rasterization using z-buffer to resolve visibility. As an example, the project generates a PPM file of a sample 3D cow.
2. It also contains a Projection Matrix similar to OpenGL's one.
